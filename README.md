A designed, built and tested greenhouse environment controller system on a PCB with the **ATMega328P** at the heart of operations with other integrated sensors such as the **DHT20**, **DS18B20** and **LDR** which output real-time data to a **Grove RGB LCD** module. Ideal temperature set by a **potentiometer** and a **relay-controlled fan** to activate when greenhouse conditions become unideal. The **ESP8266** as part of _IoT_ to send the live data to charts on _ThingsSpeak_ for visualizing and embedding in a website. With a **9V battery** powering it all.
